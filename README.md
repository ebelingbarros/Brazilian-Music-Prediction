## The project
The business analytics team Fleur Delacour, aka the authors of this project, were asked to answer some business questions for a real estate company using a dataset of almost 22.000 real estate sales in Washington state, USA.

To answer the basic questions of the business, we imported the data into a SQL database using MySQL and the MySQL Workbench client.

Additionally, the company wanted to explore some relationships within the data using visualizations to make these relationships easy to consume for the stakeholders and decision-makers. We used Tableau to achieve this goal.

Finally, the company wanted to predict the price of real estate units with the given data. 
We achieved this by applying multiple linear regression algorithms after cleaning and wrangling the data with python in Jupyter Notebook.
After our first approach, we finetuned the model to increase the precision of our predictions.

After our analysis was completed, we delivered our insights in a 5-minute presentation, focussing on the business implications of our results.
